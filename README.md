## Educative 30 Days of Code

## About the Challenge
This repository serves as a public log of my progress through the Educative 30 Days of Code challenge. Each day, I'll be solving a new coding problem provided by the program to build a consistent coding habit, deepen my understanding of algorithms, and improve my problem-solving skills. My goal is to use this repository as a living portfolio of my work.

## Key Concepts & Technologies
* Languages: Python (Primary)

* Data Structures: Arrays, Hash Maps, Heaps, Trees, Graphs

* Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion

 ## Let's Connect!
I'm excited to share this journey with the community. Feel free to check out my solutions, leave feedback, or connect with me on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/adithya-k-0b972431a/].
